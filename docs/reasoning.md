# Reasoning behind GlobeTalk Design

## Colour Scheme

We selected a blue colour scheme for our GlobeTalk interface. Blue is mostly associated
with the sky and the ocean, which highlights the theme of global connection and being able
to interact with people around the world and not be limited by geographical borders. We
chose a lighter shade of blue for most of the pages’ background to incorporate a sense of
calmness, while using the app, and a darker blue for the buttons to provide a contrast to
guide user focus to key actions.

## Images and  Icons
- Globe Icon: The globe icon is to show that platform is international and allows user
to connect at a global level.
- Clouds: The clouds symbolize openness and the idea of being connected “through
the air”, similar to how messages travel digitally across the world.
- Human illustrations: The human illustrations portray the diversity in race, gender,
cultures and interests of people who could potentially use our platform.

## Alignment with GlobeTalk’s Values
GlobeTalk’s purpose is to help users find like-minded friends worldwide through language
and cultural exchange. Our values are Global Diversity, Anonymity and Safety, Meaningful
Connection, Respect and Kindness. The blue tones, global imagery, and soft illustrations
work together to reinforce these values by:

- Conveying the global connectivity of the platform.
- Promoting feelings of safety and trust for international communication.
- Creating an inviting and visually engaging space that encourages exploration.
